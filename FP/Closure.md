A [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_\(computer_programming\)) is a [[Function]] that references variables from outside its own function body. The function definition _and its environment_ are bundled together into a single entity.

Put simply, a closure is just a function that **keeps track of some values** from the place where it was _defined_, no matter where it is executed later on.

## Example

The `concatter()` function returns a function called `doc_builder` (yay higher-order functions!) that has a reference to an _enclosed_ `doc` value.

```py
def concatter():
    doc = ""
    def doc_builder(word):
        # "nonlocal" tells Python to use the 'doc'
        # variable from the enclosing scope
        nonlocal doc
        doc += word + " "
        return doc
    return doc_builder

# save the returned 'doc_builder' function
# to the new function 'harry_potter_aggregator'
harry_potter_aggregator = concatter()
harry_potter_aggregator("Mr.")
harry_potter_aggregator("and")
harry_potter_aggregator("Mrs.")
harry_potter_aggregator("Dursley")
harry_potter_aggregator("of")
harry_potter_aggregator("number")
harry_potter_aggregator("four,")
harry_potter_aggregator("Privet")

print(harry_potter_aggregator("Drive"))
# Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive
```

When `concatter()` is called, it creates a new "stateful" function that _remembers_ the value of its internal `doc` variable. Each successive call to `harry_potter_aggregator` appends to that same `doc`.

## nonlocal
Python has a keyword called [[nonlocal]] that's required to modify a variable from an enclosing scope. Most programming languages don't require this keyword, but Python does.



Remember, a [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_\(computer_programming\)) is a function that retains the state of its environment. That makes it useful for tracking data as it changes over time, but it can come at the cost of understandability.

When not to use the `nonlocal` keyword: when the variable is mutable (such as a list, dictionary or set), and you are modifying its contents rather than reassigning the variable. You only need the `nonlocal` keyword if you are reassigning a variable instead of modifying its contents (which you must do to change immutable values such as strings and integers).

Let's try a closure without the `nonlocal` keyword.
